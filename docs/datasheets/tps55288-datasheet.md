# 9 Power Supply Recommendations

The device is designed to operate from an input voltage supply range between $2 . 7 \times$ to $3 6 \ \mathsf { V } .$ This input supply must be well regulated. If the input supply is located more than a few inches from the converter, additional bulk capacitance can be required in addition to the ceramic bypass capacitors. A typical choice is an aluminum electrolytic capacitor with a value of $1 0 0 \mu \mathsf { F } .$ .

# 10 Layout 10.1 Layout Guidelines

As for all switching power supplies, especially those running at high switching frequency and high currents, layout is an important design step. If layout is not carefully done, the regulator can suffer from instability and noise problems. To maximize efficiency, switching rise time and fall time are very fast. To prevent radiation of high-frequency noise (for example, EMI), proper layout of the high-frequency switching path is essential. Minimize the length and area of all traces connected to the SW1 and SW2 pins, and always use a ground plane under the switching regulator to minimize interplane coupling. The input capacitor needs to be close to the VIN pin and the PGND to reduce the input supply current ripple.

The most critical current path for buck converter portion is from the switching FET at the buck side, through the rectifier FET at the buck side to the PGND, then the input capacitors, and back to the input of the switching FET. This high current path contains nanosecond rise time and fall time, and should be kept as short as possible. Therefore, the input capacitor for power stage must be close to the input of the switching FET and the PGND terminal of the rectifier FET.

The most critical current path for boost converter portion is from the switching FET at the boost side, through the rectifier FET at boost side, then the output capacitors, and back to ground of the switching FET. This high current path contains nanosecond rise time and fall time, and should be kept as short as possible. Therefore, the output capacitor needs not only to be close to the VOUT pin, but also to the PGND pin to reduce the overshoot at the SW2 pin and the VOUT pin.

The traces from the output current sensing resistor to the ISP pin and the ISN pin must be in parallel and close to each other to avoid noise coupling.

The PGND plane and the AGND plane are connected at the terminal of the capacitor at the VCC pin. Thus the noise caused by the MOSFET driver and parasitic inductance does not interfere with the AGND and internal control circuit.

To get good thermal performance, it is recommended to use thermal vias beneath the TPS55288 connecting the PGND pin to the PGND plane, and the VOUT pin to a large VOUT area separately.

Figure 7-6. Output Voltage Rise vs Output Current

# 7.3.13 Integrated Gate Drivers

The TPS55288 provides two N-channel MOSFET gate drivers for buck side. Each driver is capable of sourcing 1-A and sinking 1.8-A peak current. In buck operation, the DR1H pin and the DR1L pin are switched by the PWM controller. In boost mode, the DR1H pin remains at continuously high voltage to turn on the high-side MOSFET of the buck side, and the DR1L pin remains at continuously low voltage to turn off the low-side MOSFET of the buck side.

In DCM buck mode operation, the DR1L turns off the low-side FET when the inductor current drops to zero.

The low-side gate driver is powered from the VCC pin, and the high-side gate driver is powered from th bootstrap capacitor $\mathsf { C } _ { \mathsf { B O O T } 1 }$ , which is between the BOOT1 pin and the SW1 pin.

# 7.3.14 Output Current Limit

The output current limit is programmable from 0 A to 6.35 A by placing a $1 0 \cdot \mathsf { m } \Omega$ current sensing resistor between the ISP pin and the ISN pin. Smaller resistance results in a higher current limit and bigger resistance results in a lower current limit. An internal register sets the current sense voltage across the ISP pin and the ISN pin. The programmable voltage step between the ISP pin and the ISN pin is $0 . 5 \mathsf { m V } .$

Connecting the ISP and the ISN pin together to the VOUT pin disables the output current limit because the sensed voltage is always zero. The output current limit can also be disabled by reset the Current_Limit_EN bit in the Current_Limit register to 0.

When the OE bit or the Current_Limit_EN bit is changed from 0 to 1, the OCP_MASK must be 0. After the OE bit and the Current_Limit_EN bit are set, set the OCP_MASK to 1 to enable the OCP fault indication output.

# 7.3.15 Overvoltage Protection

The TPS55288 has output overvoltage protection. When the output voltage at the VOUT pin is detected above $2 3 . 5 \mathrm { ~ V ~ }$ typically, the TPS55288 turns off two high-side FETs and turns on two low-side FETs until its output voltage drops the hysteresis value lower than the output overvoltage protection threshold. This function prevents overvoltage on the output and secures the circuits connected to the output from excessive overvoltage.

# 7.3.16 Output Short Circuit Protection

In addition to the average inductor current limit, the TPS55288 implements the output short-circuit protection by entering hiccup mode. To enable hiccup mode, the HICCUP bit in register 06h must be set. After soft start-up time of $4 \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s }$ , the TPS55288 monitors the average inductor current and output voltage. Whenever the output short circuit happens, causing the average inductor current hitting the set limit and the output voltage below 0.8 V, the TPS55288 shuts down the switching for 76 ms (typical) and then repeats the soft start for $4 \mathrm { \ m s }$ . The hiccup mode helps reduce the total power dissipation on the TPS55288 in the output short-circuit or overcurrent condition.

# 7.3.17 Thermal Shutdown

The TPS55288 is protected by a thermal shutdown circuit that shuts down the device when the internal junction temperature exceeds $1 7 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (typical). The internal soft-start circuit is reset but all internal registers values remain unchanged when thermal shutdown is triggered. The converter automatically restarts when the junction temperature drops below the thermal shutdown hysteresis of $\boldsymbol { 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ below the thermal shutdown threshold.

# 7.4 Device Functional Modes

In light load condition, the TPS55288 can work in PFM or forced PWM mode to meet different application requirements. The PFM mode decreases switching frequency to reduce the switching loss thus it gets high efficiency at light load condition. The FPWM mode keeps the switching frequency unchanged to avoid undesired low switching frequency but the efficiency becomes lower than that of PFM mode.

# 7.4.1 PWM Mode

In FPWM mode, the TPS55288 keeps the switching frequency unchanged in light load condition. When the load current decreases, the output of the internal error amplifier decreases as well to reduce the average inductor current down to deliver less power from input to output. When the output current further reduces, the current through the inductor decreases to zero during the switch-off time. The high-side N-MOSFET is not turned off even if the current through the MOSFET is zero. Thus, the inductor current changes its direction after it runs to zero. The power flow is from output side to input side. The efficiency is low in this condition. However, with the fixed switching frequency, there is no audible noise or other problems that might be caused by low switching frequency in light load condition.

# 7.4.2 Power Save Mode

The TPS55288 improves the efficiency at light load condition with the PFM mode. By connecting an appropriate resistor at the MODE pin or enabling the PFM function in the internal register, the TPS55288 can work in PFM mode at light load condition. When the TPS55288 operates at light load condition, the output of the internal error amplifier decreases to make the inductor peak current down to deliver less power to the load. When the output current further reduces, the current through the inductor will decrease to zero during the switch-off time. When the TPS55288 works in buck mode, once the inductor current becomes zero, the low-side switch of the buck side is turned off to prevent the reverse current from output to ground. When the TPS55288 works in boost mode, once the inductor current becomes zero, the high side-switch of the boost side is turned off to prevent the reverse current from output to input. The TPS55288 resumes switching until the output voltage drops. Thus the PFM mode reduces switching cycles and eliminates the power loss by the reverse inductor current to get high efficiency in light load condition.

# 7.5 I2C Serial Interface

The TPS55288 uses $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ interface for flexible converter parameter programming. $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ is a bi-directional 2-wire serial interface. Only two bus lines are required: a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). ${ \mathsf { I } } ^ { 2 } { \mathsf { C } }$ devices can be considered as masters or slaves when performing data transfers. A master is the device that initiates a data transfer on the bus and generates the clock signals to permit that transfer. At that time, any device addressed is considered a slave.

The TPS55288 operates as a slave device with address 74h and 75h set by a different resistor at the MODE pin. Receiving control inputs from the master device like a microcontroller or a digital signal processor reads and writes the internal registers 00h through 07h. The $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ interface of the TPS55288 supports both standard mode (up to $1 0 0 \ \mathsf { k b i t } / \mathsf { s } )$ and fast mode plus (up to 1000 kbit/s). Both SDA and SCL must be connected to the positive supply voltage through current sources or pullup resistors. When the bus is free, both lines are in high voltage.

# 7.5.1 Data Validity

The data on the SDA line must be stable during the high level period of the clock. The high level or low level state of the data line can only change when the clock signal on the SCL line is low level. One clock pulse is generated for each data bit transferred.

Figure 7-7. I2C Data Validity

# 7.5.2 START and STOP Conditions

All transactions begin with a START (S) and can be terminated by a STOP (P). A high level to low level transition on the SDA line while SCL is at high level defines a START condition. A low level to high level transition on the SDA line when the SCL is at high level defines a STOP condition.

START and STOP conditions are always generated by the master. The bus is considered busy after the START condition, and free after the STOP condition.

# 7.5.3 Byte Format

Every byte on the SDA line must be eight bits long. The number of bytes to be transmitted per transfer is unrestricted. Each byte has to be followed by an acknowledge bit. Data is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first. If a slave cannot receive or transmit another complete byte of data until it has performed some other function, it can hold the clock line SCL low to force the master into a wait state (clock stretching). Data transfer then continues when the slave is ready for another byte of data and release the clock line SCL.

Figure 7-9. Byte Format

# 7.5.4 Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NACK)

The acknowledge takes place after every byte. The acknowledge bit allows the receiver to signal the transmitter that the byte was successfully received and another byte may be sent. All clock pulses, including the acknowledge ${ \mathfrak { g m } }$ clock pulse, are generated by the master.

The transmitter releases the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so the receiver can pull the SDA line to low level and it remains stable low level during the high level period of this clock pulse.

The Not Acknowledge signal is when SDA remains high level during the ${ \mathfrak { g m } }$ clock pulse. The master can the generate either a STOP to abort the transfer or a repeated START to start a new transfer.

# 7.5.5 Slave Address and Data Direction Bit

After the START, a slave address is sent. This address is seven bits long followed by the eighth bit as a data direction bit (bit $\mathsf { R } / \overline { { \mathsf { W } } } )$ ). A zero indicates a transmission (WRITE) and a one indicates a request for data (READ).

# 7.6.1 REF Register (Address $\mathbf { \mu = 0 h }$ , 1h) [reset $=$ 11010010h, 00000000h]

REF is shown in Figure 7-15 and Figure 7-16 described in Table 7-4.

# Return to Summary Table.

REF sets the internal reference voltage of the TPS55288. The 01h register is the high byte and the 00h register is the low byte. One LSB of register 00h stands for $1 . 1 2 9 \mathrm { ~ m V }$ of the internal reference voltage. The default register value is 00000000 11010010b of $2 8 2 \ \mathsf { m V } .$ When the register value is 00000000 00000000b, the reference voltage is $4 5 ~ \mathsf { m V } .$ When the register value is 00000011 11000000b, the reference voltage is 1.129 V. The output voltage of the TPS55288 also depends on the output feedback ratio, which is either set in register 04h or set by an external resistor divider.

Writing register 01h enables the TPS55288 to load the 01h and 00h data into the internal 10-bit DAC. Writing the register 00h does not impact the internal reference voltage.

VOUT_SR is shown in Figure 7-18 and described in Table 7-6.

Return to Summary Table.

Register 03h sets the slew rate of the output voltage change and the response delay time after the output current exceeds the setting output current limit.

The OCP_DELAY [1:0] bits set the response time of the TPS55288 when the output overcurrent limit is hit. This allows the TPS55288 to output high current in a relative short duration time. The default setting is $1 2 8 \mu \mathsf { s }$ so that the TPS55288 immediately limits the output current.

The SR [1:0] bits set $1 . 2 5 \mathsf { m V } / \mu \mathsf { s }$ , $2 . 5 \mathsf { m V } / \mathsf { \mu s }$ , 5mV/μs, and $1 0 \mathsf { m V } / \mu \mathsf { s }$ slew rate for output voltage change.

# 7.6.7 STATUS Register (Address $=$ 7h) [reset $=$ 00000011h]

STATUS is shown in Figure 7-22 and described in Table 7-11.

# Return to Summary Table.

The STATUS register stores the operating status of the TPS55288. When any of the SCP bit, the OCP bit, or the OVP bit are set, and the corresponding mask bit in register 05h is set as well, the FB/,17ࡄ pin outputs low logic level to indicate the situation. Reading register 07h clears the SCP bit, OCP bit, and OVP bit. After the SCP bit, OCP bit, or OVP bit is set, it does not reset until the register is read. If the situation still exists, the corresponding bit is set again.

# 8 Application and Implementation

# Note

Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design implementation to confirm system functionality.

# 8.1 Application Information

The TPS55288 can operate over a wide range of $2 . 7 . \mathrm { V }$ to 36-V input voltage and output $0 . 8 \ V$ to $^ { 2 2 \lor . }$ It can transition among buck mode, buck-boost mode, and boost mode smoothly according to the input voltage and the setting output voltage. The TPS55288 operates in buck mode when the input voltage is greater than the output voltage and in boost mode when the input voltage is less than the output voltage. When the input voltage is close to the output voltage, the TPS55288 operates in one-cycle buck and one-cycle boost mode alternately. The switching frequency is set by an external resistor. To reduce the switching power loss in high power conditions, it is recommended to set the switching frequency below $5 0 0 ~ \mathsf { k H z }$ . If a system requires higher switching frequency above $5 0 0 ~ { \mathsf { k H z } }$ , it is recommended to set the lower switch current limit for better thermal performance.

# 8.2 Typical Application

The TPS55288 provides a small size solution for USB PD power supply application with the input voltage ranging from 9 V to $_ { 2 0 \lor . }$

# 8.2.2 USB PD Power Supply Detailed Design Procedure

# 8.2.2.1 Switching Frequency

The switching frequency of the TPS55288 is set by a resistor at the FSW pin. Use Equation 3 to calculate the resistance for the desired frequency. To reduce the switching power loss with such a high current application, a $1 \%$ standard resistor of $4 9 . 9 \mathsf { k } \Omega$ is selected for 400-kHz switching frequency for this application.

# 8.2.2.2 Output Voltage Setting

The TPS55288 has $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ interface to set the internal reference voltage. A microcontroller can easily set the desired output voltage by writing the proper data into the reference voltage registers through ${ \mathsf { I } } ^ { 2 } { \mathsf { C } }$ bus.

# 8.2.2.3 Inductor Selection

Since the selection of the inductor affects steady state operation, transient behavior, and loop stability, the inductor is the most important component in power regulator design. There are three important inductor specifications: inductance, saturation current, and DC resistance.

The TPS55288 is designed to work with inductor values between $1 \ \mu \ H$ and $1 0 ~ \mu \mathsf { H }$ . The inductor selection is based on consideration of both buck and boost modes of operation.

For buck mode, the inductor selection is based on limiting the peak-to-peak current ripple to the maximum inductor current at the maximum input voltage. In CCM, Equation 9 shows the relationship between the inductance and the inductor ripple current.

$$
L = \frac { \big ( \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N ( M A X ) } } - \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } \big ) \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } } { \Delta \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P } \mathrm { - } \mathsf { P } ) } \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { S W } } \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N ( M A X ) } } }
$$

# where

$\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } ( \mathsf { M A X } ) }$ is the maximum input voltage   
$\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ is the output voltage   
$\Delta \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P } - \mathsf { P } ) }$ is the peak to peak ripple current of the inductor   
$\mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { S W } }$ is the switching frequency

For a certain inductor, the inductor ripple current achieves maximum value when VOUT equals half of the maximum input voltage. Choosing higher inductance gets smaller inductor current ripple while smaller inductance gets larger inductor current ripple.

For boost mode, the inductor selection is based on limiting the peak-to-peak current ripple to the maximum inductor current at the maximum output voltage. In CCM, Equation 10 shows the relationship between the inductance and the inductor ripple current.

$$
\mathsf { L } = \frac { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } \times \left( \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } ( \mathsf { M A X } ) } - \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } \right) } { \Delta \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P } - \mathsf { P } ) } \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { S W } } \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } ( \mathsf { M A X } ) } }
$$

# where

$V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ is the input voltage • $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } ( \mathsf { M A X } ) }$ is the maximum output voltage $\Delta \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P } - \mathsf { P } ) }$ is the peak to peak ripple current of the inductor $\mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { S W } }$ is the switching frequency

For a certain inductor, the inductor ripple current achieves maximum value when $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ equals to the half of the maximum output voltage. Choosing higher inductance gets smaller inductor current ripple while smaller inductance gets larger inductor current ripple.

For this application example, a $4 . 7 – \mu \ H$ inductor is selected, which produces approximate maximum inductor current ripple of $50 \%$ of the highest average inductor current in buck mode and $50 \%$ of the highest average inductor current in boost mode.

In buck mode, the inductor DC current equals to the output current. In boost mode, the inductor DC current can be calculated with Equation 11.

$$
| \mathsf { \Pi } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { D C } ) } = \frac { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } \times \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } } { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } \times \mathsf { I } }
$$

# where

• $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ is the output voltage IOUT is the output current $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ is the input voltage $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { n } }$ is the power conversion efficiency

For a given maximum output current of the buck-boost converter TPS55288, the maximum inductor DC current happens at the minimum input voltage and maximum output voltage. Set the inductor current limit of the TPS55288 higher than the calculated maximum inductor DC current to make sure the TPS55288 has the desired output current capability.

In boost mode, the inductor ripple current is calculated with Equation 12.

$$
\Delta \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P - P } ) } \mathrm { = } \frac { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } \times ( \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } - \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } ) } { \mathsf { L } \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { S W } } \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } }
$$

# where

$\Delta \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P } - \mathsf { P } ) }$ is the inductor ripple current L is the inductor value fSW is the switching frequency $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ is the output voltage $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ is the input voltage

Therefore, the inductor peak current is calculated with Equation 13.

$$
A _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P } ) } = \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { D C } ) } + \frac { \Delta \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { L } ( \mathsf { P } - \mathsf { P } ) } } { 2 }
$$

Normally, it is advisable to work with an inductor peak-to-peak current of less than $40 \%$ of the average inductor current for maximum output current. A smaller ripple from a larger valued inductor reduces the magnetic hysteresis losses in the inductor and EMI, but in the same way, load transient response time is increased. The selected inductor must have higher saturation current than the calculated peak current.

The conversion efficiency is dependent on the resistance of its current path. The switching loss associated with the switching MOSFETs, and the inductor core loss. Therefore, the overall efficiency is affected by the inductor

DC resistance (DCR), equivalent series resistance (ESR) at the switching frequency, and the core loss. Table 8-2 lists recommended inductors for the TPS55288. In this application example, the Coilcraft inductor XAL1010-472 is selected for its small size, high saturation current, and small DCR.

# 8.2.2.4 Input Capacitor

In buck mode, the input capacitor supplies high ripple current. The RMS current in the input capacitors is given by Equation 14.

$$
| \mathsf { \Gamma } _ { \mathsf { C I N } ( \mathsf { R M S } ) } = \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } \times \sqrt { \frac { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } \times ( \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } - \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } ) } { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } } }
$$

where

• ICIN(RMS) is the RMS current through the input capacitor • IOUT is the output current

The maximum RMS current occurs at the output voltage is half of the input voltage, which gives $\mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { C I N } ( \mathsf { R M S } ) } = \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } /$ 2. Ceramic capacitors are recommended for their low ESR and high ripple current capability. A total of $2 0 ~ \mu \mathsf { F }$ effective capacitance is a good starting point for this application.

# 8.2.2.5 Output Capacitor

In boost mode, the output capacitor conducts high ripple current. The output capacitor RMS ripple current is given by Equation 15, where the minimum input voltage and the maximum output voltage correspond to the maximum capacitor current.

$$
\mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { C O U T } ( \mathsf { R M S } ) } = \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } \times \sqrt { \frac { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } } { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I N } } } } - 1
$$

# where

• ICOUT(RMS) is the RMS current through the output capacitor • IOUT is the output current

In this example, the maximum output ripple RMS current is 5.5 A.

The ESR of the output capacitor causes an output voltage ripple given by Equation 16 in boost mode.

$$
V _ { \mathsf { R I P P L E ( E S R ) } } = \frac { \mathsf { I _ { O U T } } \times \mathsf { V _ { O U T } } } { \mathsf { V _ { I N } } } \times \mathsf { R _ { C O U T } }
$$

where

# • RCOUT is the ESR of the output capacitance

The capacitance also causes a capacitive output voltage ripple given by Equation 17 in boost mode. When input voltage reaches the minimum value and the output voltage reaches the maximum value, there is the largest output voltage ripple caused by the capacitance.

$$
V _ { \mathsf { R I P P L E ( C A P ) } } = \frac { \mathsf { I _ { O U T } } \times \left( 1 - \frac { \mathsf { V _ { I N } } } { \mathsf { V _ { O U T } } } \right) } { \mathsf { C _ { O U T } } \times \mathsf { f _ { S W } } }
$$

Typically, a combination of ceramic capacitors and bulk electrolytic capacitors is needed to provide low ESR, high ripple current, and small output voltage ripple. From the required output voltage ripple, use Equation 16 and Equation 17 to calculate the minimum required effective capacitance of the ${ \mathsf { C o u r } }$ .

# 8.2.2.6 Output Current Limit

The output current limit is implemented by putting a current sense resistor between the ISP and ISN pins along with setting a limit voltage between the ISP pin and the ISN pin through register 02h. The maximum value of the limit voltage between the ISP and ISN pins is $6 3 . 5 ~ \mathsf { m V } .$ The default limit voltage is $5 0 ~ \mathsf { m V } .$ The current sense resistor between the ISP and ISN pins should be selected to ensure that the output current limit is set high enough for output. The output current limit setting resistor is given by Equation 18.

$$
\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { S N S } } = \frac { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { S N S } } } { \mathsf { I } _ { \mathsf { O U T \_ L I M I T } } }
$$

where

• $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { S N S } }$ is the current limit setting voltage between the ISP and ISN pins • IOUT_LIMIT is the desired output current limit

Because the power dissipation is large, make sure the current sense resistor has enough power dissipation capability with large package.

# 8.2.2.7 Loop Stability

The TPS55288 uses average current control scheme. The inner current loop uses internal compensation and requires the inductor value must be larger than $1 . 2 / \mathfrak { f } _ { \mathsf { S W } }$ . The outer voltage loop requires an external compensation. The COMP pin is the output of the internal voltage error amplifier. An external compensation network comprised of resistor and ceramic capacitors is connected to the COMP pin.

The TPS55288 operates in buck mode or boost mode. Therefore, both buck and boost operating modes require loop compensations. The restrictive one of both compensations is selected as the overall compensation from a loop stability point of view. Typically for a converter designed either work in buck mode or boost mode, the boost mode compensation design is more restrictive due to the presence of a right half plane zero (RHPZ).

The power stage in boost mode can be modeled by Equation 19.

$$
\mathsf { G } _ { \mathsf { P S } } ( \mathsf { s } ) = \frac { \mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { L O A D } } \times ( 1 - \mathsf { D } ) } { 2 \times \mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { S E N S E } } } \times \frac { \left( 1 + \frac { \mathsf { s } } { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { E S R Z } } } \right) \times \left( 1 - \frac { \mathsf { s } } { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { R H P Z } } } \right) } { 1 + \frac { \mathsf { s } } { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { P } } } }
$$

where

• $\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { L O A D } }$ is the output load resistance D is the switching duty cycle in boost mode   
RSENSE is the equivalent internal current sense resistor, which is 0.055 Ω

The power stage has two zeros and one pole generated by the output capacitor and load resistance. Use Equation 20 to Equation 22 to calculate them.

$$
\mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { P } } = \frac { 2 } { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { L O A D } } \times \mathsf { C } _ { \mathsf { O U T } } }
$$

The internal transconductance amplifier together with the compensation network at the COMP pin constitutes the control portion of the loop. The transfer function of the control portion is shown by Equation 23.

$$
\mathsf { G } _ { \mathtt { C } } ( \mathsf { S } ) = \frac { \mathsf { G } _ { \mathtt { E A } } \times \mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { E A } } \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathtt { R E F } } } { \mathsf { V } _ { \mathtt { O U T } } } \times \frac { \left( 1 + \frac { \mathsf { S } } { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathtt { C O M P } } } \right) } { \left( 1 + \frac { \mathsf { S } } { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathtt { C O M P } 1 } } \right) \times \left( 1 + \frac { \mathsf { S } } { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathtt { C O M P } 2 } } \right) }
$$

where

$\mathsf { G } _ { \mathsf { E A } }$ is the transconductance of the error amplifier $\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { E A } }$ is the output resistance of the error amplifier VREF is the reference voltage input to the error amplifier $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ is the output voltage • fCOMP1 and fCOMP2 are the pole’s frequency of the compensation network • fCOMZ is the zero’s frequency of the compensation network

The total open-loop gain is the product of $\mathsf { G } _ { \mathsf { P S } } ( \mathsf { s } )$ and ${ \sf G } _ { \sf C } ( { \sf s } )$ . The next step is to choose the loop crossover frequency, $\mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ , at which the total open-loop gain is 1, namely 0 dB. The higher in frequency that the loop gain stays above 0 dB before crossing over, the faster the loop response. It is generally accepted that the loop gain cross over 0 dB at the frequency no higher than the lower of either $\boldsymbol { 1 } / \boldsymbol { 1 0 }$ of the switching frequency, $\mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { S W } }$ or 1/5 of the RHPZ frequency, fRHPZ.

Then, set the value of $\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { C } } , \mathsf { C } _ { \mathsf { C } }$ and $C _ { \mathsf { P } }$ by Equation 24 to Equation 26.

$$
\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { C } } = \frac { 2 \pi \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathrm { O U T } } \times \mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { S E N S E } } \times \mathsf { C } _ { \mathrm { O U T } } \times \mathsf { f } _ { \mathsf { C } } } { ( 1 \cdot \mathsf { D } ) \times \mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { R E F } } \times \mathsf { G } _ { \mathsf { E A } } }
$$

where

# 3 Description

The TPS55288 is a synchronous four-switch buckboost converter capable of regulating the output voltage at, above, or below the input voltage. The TPS55288 operates over $2 . 7 . \mathrm { V }$ to 36-V wide input voltage and capable of outputing $0 . 8 – \lor$ to 22-V voltage to support a variety of applications.

The TPS55288 integrates two 16-A MOSFETs of the boost leg to balance the solution size and efficiency. With the programmable output voltage and output current limit through ${ \mathsf { I } } ^ { 2 } { \mathsf { C } }$ interface, the TPS55288 is fully compliant to the USB PD specification. The TPS55288 is capable of delivering 100 W from 12-V input voltage.

The TPS55288 employs average current-mode control scheme. The switching frequency is programmable from 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz by an external resistor and can be synchronized to an external clock. The TPS55288 also provides optional spread spectrum to minimize peak EMI.

The TPS55288 offers output over-voltage protection, average inductor current limit, cycle-by-cycle peak current limit and output short circuit protection. The TPS55288 also ensures safe operating with optional output current limit and hiccup-mode protection in sustained overload conditions.

The TPS55288 can use a small inductor and small capacitors with high switching frequency. It is available in $4 . 0 \mathrm { - } \mathsf { m m } \times 3 . 5 \mathrm { - } \mathsf { m m } \mathsf { Q F N }$ package.

# 7 Detailed Description 7.1 Overview

The TPS55288 is a 16-A buck-boost DC-to-DC converter with the two boost MOSFETs integrated. The TPS55288 can operate over a wide range of 2.7-V to 36-V input voltage and an output voltage of $0 . 8 \vee$ to $^ { 2 2 \lor . }$ It can transition among buck mode, buck-boost mode, and boost mode smoothly according to the input voltage and the set output voltage. The TPS55288 operates in buck mode when the input voltage is greater than the output voltage and in boost mode when the input voltage is less than the output voltage. When the input voltage is close to the output voltage, the TPS55288 operates in one-cycle buck and one-cycle boost mode alternately.

The TPS55288 uses an average current mode control scheme. Current mode control provides simplified loop compensation, rapid response to the load transients, and inherent line voltage rejection. An error amplifier compares the feedback voltage with the internal reference voltage. The output of the error amplifier determines the average inductor current.

An internal oscillator can be configured to operate over a wide range of frequency from $2 0 0 ~ \mathsf { k H z }$ to 2.2 MHz. The internal oscillator can also synchronize to an external clock applied to the DITH/SYNC pin. To minimize EMI, the TPS55288 can dither the switching frequency at $\pm 7 \%$ of the set frequency.

The TPS55288 works in fixed-frequency PWM mode at moderate to heavy load currents. In light load condition, the TPS55288 can be configured to automatically transition to PFM mode or be forced in PWM mode by either connecting a resistor at the MODE pin or setting the corresponding bit in an internal register.

The output voltage of the TPS55288 is adjustable by setting the internal register through $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ interface. An internal 10-bit DAC adjusts the reference voltage related to the value written into the REF register. The device can also limit the output current by placing a current sense resistor in the output path. These two functions support the programmable power supply (PPS) feature of the USB PD.

The TPS55288 provides average inductor current limit set by a resistor at the ILIM pin. In addition, it provides cycle-by-cycle peak inductor current limit during transient to protect the device against overcurrent condition beyond the capability of the device.

A precision voltage threshold of $1 . 2 3 \mathrm { V }$ with $5 { \cdot } { \mu } A$ sourcing current at the EN/UVLO pin supports programmable input undervoltage lockout (UVLO) with hysteresis. The output overvoltage protection (OVP) feature turns off the high-side FETs to prevent damage to the devices powered by the TPS55288.

The device provides hiccup mode option to reduce the heating in the power components when output short circuit happens. When the hiccup mode is enabled, the TPS55288 turns off for 76 ms and restarts at soft startup.

# 7.3 Feature Description

# 7.3.1 VCC Power Supply

An internal LDO to supply the TPS55288 outputs regulated 5.2-V voltage at the VCC pin with $6 0 { \cdot } \mathsf { m } \mathsf { A }$ output current capability. When $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ is less than $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ , the internal LDO selects the power supply source by comparing $V _ { \sf I N }$ to a rising threshold of $_ { 6 . 2 \vee }$ with $0 . 3 – \mathsf { V }$ hysteresis. When $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ is higher than $6 . 2 \ V ,$ the supply for LDO is $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ . When $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ is lower than $5 . 9 \lor ,$ , the supply for LDO is $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ . When $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ is less than $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ , the internal LDO selects the power supply source by comparing $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ to a rising threshold of $_ { 6 . 2 \vee }$ with $0 . 3 – \mathsf { V }$ hysteresis. When $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ is higher than $6 . 2 \ V ,$ the supply for LDO is $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ . When $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { O U T } }$ is lower than $5 . 9 \lor ,$ , the supply for LDO is $V _ { \mathsf { I N } }$ . Table 7-1 shows the supply source selection for the internal LDO.

To minimize the power dissipation of the internal LDO when both input voltage and output voltage are high, an external $5 { - } \mathsf { V }$ power source can be applied at the VCC pin to supply the TPS55288. The external 5-V power supply must have at least $1 0 0 { \cdot } \mathsf { m } \mathsf { A }$ output current capability and must be within the $4 . 7 5 – \lor$ to $5 . 5 – \lor$ regulation range. To use an external power supply for $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { C C } }$ , a resistor with proper resistance must be connected to the MODE pin.

# 7.3.2 Operation Mode Setting

By placing different resistors between the MODE pin and AGND pin, the TPS55288 selects the internal power supply or external power supply for $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { C C } }$ , selects one of two different $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ addresses, and selects the PFM mode or the forced PWM mode in light load conditions. Table 7-2 shows the resistance values for each selection. After the TPS55288 is enabled, an $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ master device can control these three operating modes by writing the corresponding value into the internal registers regardless the resistance settings at the MODE pin. See details in Section 7.6.

# 7.3.3 Input Undervoltage Lockout

When the input voltage is below $2 . 6 \ V ,$ the TPS55288 is disabled. When the input voltage is above ${ } _ { 3 } \lor ,$ the TPS55288 can be enabled by pulling the EN pin to a high voltage above $1 . 3 \lor .$ .

# 7.3.4 Enable and Programmable UVLO

The TPS55288 has a dual function enable and undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. When the input voltage at the VIN pin is above the input UVLO rising threshold of $\textsf { 3 V }$ and the EN/UVLO pin is pulled above $1 . 1 5 \mathrm { V }$ but less than the enable UVLO threshold of $1 . 2 3 \lor ,$ the TPS55288 is enabled but still in standby mode. The TPS55288 starts to detect the resistance between the MODE pin and ground. After that, the TPS55288 selects the power supply for $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { C C } }$ , the $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ slave address, and the PFM or FPWM mode for light load condition accordingly.

The EN/UVLO pin has an accurate UVLO voltage threshold to support programmable input undervoltage lockout with hysteresis. When the EN/UVLO pin voltage is greater than the UVLO threshold of $1 . 2 3 \lor ,$ the TPS55288 is enabled for ${ \mathsf { I } } ^ { 2 } { \mathsf { C } }$ communication and switching operation. A hysteresis current IUVLO_HYS is sourced out of the EN/ UVLO pin to provide hysteresis that prevents on/off chattering in the presence of noise with a slowly changing input voltage.

By using resistor divider as shown in Figure 7-1, the turnon threshold is calculated using Equation 1.

$$
V _ { I N ( U V L O \_ O N ) } = V _ { U V L O } \times ( 1 + { \frac { \mathrm { R 1 } } { R 2 } } )
$$

where

• $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { U V L O } }$ is the UVLO threshold of $1 . 2 3 \lor$ at the EN/UVLO pin

The hysteresis between the UVLO turnon threshold and turnoff threshold is set by the upper resistor in the EN/ UVLO resistor divider and is given by the Equation 2.

$$
\Delta V _ { I N ( U V L O ) } = I _ { U V L O \_ H Y S } \ \times R 1
$$

# where

• IUVLO_HYS is the sourcing current from the EN/UVLO pin when the voltage at the EN/UVLO pin is above VUVLO

Figure 7-1. Programmable UVLO With Resistor Divider at the EN/UVLO pin

Using an NMOSFET together with a resistor divider can implement both logic enable and programmable UVLO as shown in Figure 7-2. The EN logic high level must be greater than enable threshold plus the $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { I h } }$ of the NMOSFET Q1. The Q1 also eliminates the leakage current from VIN to ground through the UVLO resistor divider during shutdown mode.

Figure 7-2. Logic Enable and Programmable UVLO

# 7.3.5 Soft Start

When the input voltage is above the UVLO threshold and the voltage at the EN/UVLO pin is above the enable UVLO threshold, the TPS55288 is ready to accept the command from $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ master device. An $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ master device can configure the internal registers of the TPS55288 before setting the OE bit of the register 06h. Once an $\mathsf { I 2 C }$ master device sets the OE bit to 1, the TPS55288 starts to ramp up the output voltage by ramping an internal reference voltage from $0 \vee$ to a voltage set in the internal registers 00h and 01h within typical $4 \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s }$ .

# 7.3.6 Shutdown and Load Discharge

When the EN/UVLO pin voltage is pulled below $0 . 4 \lor ,$ , the TPS55288 is in shutdown mode, and all functions are disabled. All internal registers are reset to default values.

When the EN/UVLO pin is at high logic level and the OE bit is cleared to 0, the TPS55288 turns off the switching operation but keeps the ${ \mathsf { I } } ^ { 2 } { \mathsf { C } }$ interface active. Simultaneously, if the DISCHG bit in the register 06h is set to 1, the TPS55288 discharges the output voltage below $0 . 8 \vee$ by an internal constant current.

# 7.3.7 Switching Frequency

The TPS55288 uses a fixed frequency average current control scheme. The switching frequency is between 200 kHz and 2.2 MHz set by placing a resistor at the FSW pin. An internal amplifier holds this pin at a fixed voltage of

1 V. The setting resistance is between maximum of 100kΩ and minimum of $9 . 0 9 \mathrm { k } \Omega$ . Use Equation 3 to calculate the resistance by a given switching frequency.

$$
f _ { S W } = \frac { 1 0 0 0 } { 0 . 0 5 \times R _ { F S W } + 2 0 } ~ \mathrm { ( M H z ) }
$$

where

# • $\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { F S W } }$ is the resistance at the FSW pin

For noise-sensitive applications, the TPS55288 can be synchronized to an external clock signal applied to the DITH/SYNC pin. The duty cycle of the external clock is recommended in the range of $30 \%$ to $70 \%$ . A resistor also must be connected to the FSW pin when the TPS55288 is switching by the external clock. The external clock frequency at the DITH/SYNC pin must have lower than $0 . 4 \mathrm { - } \mathsf { V }$ low level voltage and must be within $\pm 3 0 \%$ of the corresponding frequency set by the resistor. Figure 7-3 is a recommended configuration.

![](../assets/tps55288-datasheet/3cdee026d0bc363c1aae5fb107c7031aab5bb96e8cc6bf384c18f84b23d8eb6c.jpg)  
Figure 7-3. External Clock Configuration

# 7.3.8 Switching Frequency Dithering

The TPS55288 provides an optional switching frequency dithering that is enabled by connecting a capacitor from the DITH/SYNC pin to ground. Figure 7-4 illustrates the dithering circuit. By charging and discharging the capacitor, a triangular waveform centered at $1 \vee$ is generated at the DITH/SYNC pin. The triangular waveform modulates the oscillator frequency by $\pm 7 \%$ of the nominal frequency set by the resistance at the FSW pin. The capacitance at the DITH/SYNC pin sets the modulation frequency. A small capacitance modulates the oscillator frequency at a fast rate than a large capacitance. For the dithering circuit to effectively reduce peak EMI, the modulation rate normally is below 1 kHz. Equation 4 calculates the capacitance required to set the modulation frequency, $\mathsf { F } _ { \mathsf { M O D } }$ .

$$
C _ { D I T H } = \frac { 1 } { 2 . 8 \times R _ { F S W } \times F _ { M O D } } \left( F \right)
$$

where

• RFSW is the switching frequency setting resistance (Ω) at the FSW pin • $\mathsf { F } _ { \mathsf { M O D } }$ is the modulation frequency $( \mathsf { H } z )$ of the dithering

Connecting the DITH/SYNC pin below $0 . 4 \lor$ or above $1 . 2 \lor$ disables switching frequency dithering. The dithering function also is disabled when an external synchronous clock is used.

Figure 7-4. Switching Frequency Dithering

# 7.3.9 Inductor Current Limit

The TPS55288 implements both peak current and average inductor current limit by a resistor connected to the ILIM pin. The average current mode control loop uses the current sense information at the high-side MOSFET of the boost leg to clamp the maximum average inductor current to 16.5 A (typical) when the resistor is ${ } ^ { 2 0 \mathsf { k } \Omega }$ . Use large resistance to get smaller average inductor current limit. Use Equation 5 to calculate the resistance for a desired average inductor current limit.

$$
I _ { A V G \_ L I M I T } = \frac { \operatorname* { m i n } ( 1 , 0 . 6 \times V _ { O U T } ) \times 3 3 0 0 0 0 } { R _ { I L I M } }
$$

# where

• IAVG_LIMIT is the average inductor current limit • ${ \mathsf { R } } _ { | \mathsf { L } | \mathsf { M } }$ is the resistance $( \Omega )$ between the ILIM pin and analog ground

Besides the average current limit, a peak current limit protection is implemented during transient to protect the device against over current condition beyond the capability of the device.

# 7.3.10 Internal Charge Path

Each of the two high-side MOSFET drivers is biased from its floating bootstrap capacitor, which is normally recharged by $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { C C } }$ through both the external and internal bootstrap diodes when the low-side MOSFET is turned on. When the TPS55288 operates exclusively in the buck or boost regions, one of the high-side MOSFETs is constantly on. An internal charge path, from VOUT and BOOT2 to BOOT1 or from VIN and BOOT1 to BOOT2, charges the bootstrap capacitor to $\mathsf { V } _ { \mathsf { C C } }$ so that the high-side MOSFET remains on.

# 7.3.11 Output Voltage Setting

There are two ways to set the output voltage: changing the feedback ratio and changing the reference voltage. The TPS55288 has a 10-bit DAC to program the reference voltage from $4 5 \mathsf { m V }$ to $1 . 2 \lor .$ The TPS55288 also can select an internal feedback resistor divider or an external resistor divider by setting the FB bit in register 04h. When the FB bit is set to 0, the output voltage feedback ratio is set in internal register $0 4 \hslash$ . When the FB bit is set to 1, the output voltage feedback ratio is set by an external resistor divider.

When using internal output voltage feedback settings, there are four feedback ratios programmable by writing the INTFB[1:0] bits of register 04h. With this function, the TPS55288 can limit the maximum output voltage to different values. In addition, the minimum step of the output voltage change is also programmed to $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m V } ;$ , 15 mV, $1 0 \mathsf { m V } ,$ , and $5 \mathsf { m V } ,$ , accordingly.

When using an external output voltage feedback resistor divider as shown in Figure 7-5, use Equation 6 to calculate the output voltage with the reference voltage at the FB/INT pin.

$$
\mathsf { V } _ { O U T } = V _ { R E F } \times ( 1 + \frac { R _ { F B \_ U P } } { R _ { F B \_ B T } } )
$$

![](../assets/tps55288-datasheet/22dc0c0c8c050faea15a745a384e7d220fd7483d7c144caae7ce92daffb1b041.jpg)  
Figure 7-5. Output Voltage Setting by External Resistor Divider

TI recommends using $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { k } \Omega$ for the up resistor $\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { F B } }$ _UP. The reference voltage $V _ { \mathsf { R E F } }$ at the FB/INT pin is programmable from $4 5 ~ \mathsf { m V }$ to $1 . 2 \lor$ by writing a 10-bit data into register 00h and 01h.

# 7.3.12 Output Current Monitoring and Cable Voltage Droop Compensation

The TPS55288 outputs a voltage at the CDC pin proportional to the sensed voltage across a output current sensing resistor between the ISP pin and the ISN pin. Equation 7 shows the exact voltage at the CDC pin related to the sensed output current.

$$
\mathrm { V } _ { C D C } = 2 0 \times ( V _ { I S P } - V _ { I S N } )
$$

To compensate the voltage droop across a cable from the output of the USB port to its powered device, the TPS55288 can lift its output voltage in proportion to the load current. There are two methods in the TPS55288 to implement the compensation: by setting internal register 05h or by placing a resistor between the CDC pin and AGND pin.

When using internal output voltage feedback, it is recommended to use the internal compensation setting. When using an external resistor divider at the FB/INT pin to set the output voltage, it is recommended to use the external compensation setting by placing a resistor at the CDC pin.

By default, the internal cable voltage droop compensation function is enabled with $_ { 0 \mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ added to the output voltage. Write the value into the bit CDC [2:0] in register 05h to get the desired voltage compensation.

When using external output voltage feedback, external compensation is better than the internal register for its high accuracy. The output voltage rises in proportion to the current sourcing from the CDC pin through the resistor at the CDC pin. It is recommended to use $1 0 0  – \ k \Omega$ resistance for the up resistor of the feedback resistor divider. Equation 8 shows the output voltage rise related to the sensed output current, the resistance at the CDC pin, and the up resistor of the output voltage feedback resistor divider.

$$
\nabla _ { O U T \_ C D C } = 3 \times R _ { F B \_ U P } \times ( \frac { V _ { I S P } - V _ { I S N } } { R _ { C D C } } )
$$

where

• $\mathsf { R } _ { \mathsf { F B \_ U P } }$ is the up resistor of the resistor divider between the output and the FB/INT pin • RCDC is the resistor at the CDC pin

When RFB_UP is $1 0 0 ~ \mathsf { k } \Omega$ , the output voltage rise versus the sensed output current and the resistor at the CDC pin is shown in Figure 7-6.
